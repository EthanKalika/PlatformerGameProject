# PlatformerGameProject
How To Use: I recommend running this code in an environment called "Processing." The runner file in this code is called "marioStyleVideoGame.pde," If you run this file, the video game will autimatically start to run.

This is a highschool project that I had stored on my computer for several years now. I uploaded it to this repository so that others can look at it and so that I can continue working on it in the future.

Some ideas I have are to add more of the video game map, add a bossfight, add a screen that displayes when the player dies or the game is won, and add in sound effects. I also want to add comments into the code.
