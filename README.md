# PlatformerGameProject
This is a highschool project that I had stored on my computer for several years now. I uploaded it to this repository so that others can look at it and so that I can continue working on it in the future.

In the comming months I want to add more of the video game map, add a bossfight, add a screen that displayes when the player dies or the game is won, and add in sound effects. I also want to add comments into the code.
